* Introduction to C Programming
* History of C
* Basic structure of C Programming

## What is Programming Language ?
* Coded language used by programmer to write instruction that a computer can understand to do what the programmer wants.
* It is used to develop software program script or other sets of instruction for computer to execute.

### low level language
low level language are in binary form which is understandable to computer. No interpreter or complier required by the low level language as it is in binary form. Low level lang. is difficult to learn.

e.g. machine language, assembly lang.

### High level language
It is design to be used by the human operator are the programmer for a computer to understand and run a program created with a high level language it must be complied into machine language. It is easy to learn.

e.g. C, C++, Java, Python

* python is interpreted lang
* C is a complied lang
* java used compiler as well as interpreter

*Complier convert whole program at a time.*
*Interpreter convert program line by line.*

## History of C

* Father of C Programming is Dennis Ritchie
* Developed in 1972
* UNIX OS is written in C lang

## Why it is called C lang ?

* C lang was created for a specific purpose i.e. designing the UNIX operating system
* Many of C principles and ideas where derived from the early lang B that why it was name as C.
* BCPL & CPL (Basic combined programming lang) & (Combined programming lang) are the earlier ancestors of B lang.
