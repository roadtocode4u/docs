## React 

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. 

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of a React project looks like this:

```bash
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

## Dom Manipulation

DOM manipulation is changing a document's structure, style, or content by using a scripting language such as JavaScript. 

## Cross Platform

Cross-platform is a term used to describe software that can use on more than one computer or operating system. For example, a cross-platform application can be used on Windows and Mac computers.

### React Components

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

There are two types of components in React:

* Class Components
* Functional Components

## Class Components

Class components are the ones which are defined as ES6 classes. They have a render method which returns a JSX. They also have a state object. They are also known as stateful or smart components.

## Functional Components

Functional components are the ones which are defined as functions. They have a return statement which returns a JSX. They do not have a state object. They are also known as stateless or dumb components.
